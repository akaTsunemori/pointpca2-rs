# PointPCA2 - Rust
#### An implementation of PointPCA2 in Rust

This project features a Rust implementation of PointPCA2, designed for faster feature computation and improved RAM management. A statistical test will be conducted to compare results from the original and Rust implementations, ensuring the validity and reliability of the adaptation.

## Roadmap
- [x] Implementation: a fully working version of PointPCA2, written entirely in Rust
- [x] Testing: extensively test the project on entire datasets 
- [ ] Statistical comparison: conduct a t-test to statistically compare the features generated from the orignal and Rust implementations

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- rustc >= 1.77.2

### Build
Simply clone this repository and run ```cargo run -r```. It it not recommended to run this project without the ```-r``` flag as the computation will be very slow for entire point clouds.

## Usage
Please refer to the *main.rs* file as it contains an example of the usage. Please keep in mind that the function for reading point clouds is **very** experimental.

```rust
fn main() {
    let search_size = 81;
    println!("Reading ply");
    let (points_a, colors_a) = ply_manager::read_ply_as_matrix("<path-to-reference>");
    let (points_b, colors_b) = ply_manager::read_ply_as_matrix("<path-to-test>");
    println!("Preprocessing");
    let (points_a, colors_a) = preprocessing::preprocess_point_cloud(&points_a, &colors_a);
    let (points_b, colors_b) = preprocessing::preprocess_point_cloud(&points_b, &colors_b);
    println!("Performing knn search");
    let knn_indices_a = knn_search::knn_search(&points_a, &points_a, search_size);
    let knn_indices_b = knn_search::knn_search(&points_b, &points_a, search_size);
    println!("Computing local features");
    let local_features = features::compute_features(
        &points_a,
        &colors_a,
        &points_b,
        &colors_b,
        &knn_indices_a,
        &knn_indices_b,
        search_size,
    );
    println!("Computing predictors");
    let predictors_result = predictors::compute_predictors(&local_features);
    println!("Pooling predictors");
    let pooled_predictors = pooling::mean_pooling(&predictors_result);
    println!("Predictors:");
    for col in pooled_predictors.iter() {
        print!("{:.4}  ", *col);
    }
    println!("");
}
```

## Validity
A statistical test is on progress to ensure the validity and reliability of this implementation.

## Results
This section is still under construction.
